# Graduation Day

It's the middle of Year 3 and Graduation Day is fast approaching!

As the brightest-of-the-bright - the dean has called you.  However, she is in a complete panic!  The dean tells you that this year's announcer for the graduation ceremony is no longer available and the dean needs a solution.

She asks if it would be possible to use face recognition and text-to-speech to do the following:

  * Display on the large on-stage screens and speak: the name, subject & qualification obtained by each graduate.  This will call them to the stage.  Also, show a picture of the graduate - which will have been taken minutes before hand backstage.

  * Use a FIFO queuing system which lists all graduates - in the order that they are required on stage (by qualification, subject and name).
  
  * Use an additional reversed screen for the on-stage team - which shows the next 6 graduates (in order) - complete with pictures and info as above.  This will give the on-stage party enough time to prepare for each graduate.
